## How to Use
1. **Installation:** First, install the required dependencies: `pip install torch enformer-pytorch pyfaidx cyvcf2 pandas numpy scipy`
2. **Prepare Data:** Convert genotype data to DNA sequences and extract expression data.
   Extract data for specified chromosome as a Plink file. Throughout this project, we use chromosome 22. 
   ```
   ./plink2 --bfile ./data/GTEx_v8_genotype_EUR_HM3_exclude_dups.allchr.reorder --chr 22 --make-bed --out gtex_chr22
   ```
   Convert Plink file into VCF
   ```
   ./plink2 --bfile ./data/gtex_chr22 --out ./data/genotype_sequences22 --recode vcf
   ```
   Extract chromosome 22 from expression data
   ```
   awk 'NR==1 || $1 == "chr1"' ./data/Whole_Blood.v8.normalized_expression.bed > ./data/chr22_expression.bed
   ```
3. **Generate Predictions:** Use the trained model to predict gene expression (`individual_prediction.py` and `gene_prediction.py`).

## **Prediction Pipeline**
### **1. Prepare Input Sequences**
- Extract **reference genome** sequences from `reference.fa`.
- Convert PLINK genotype data into **modified DNA sequences** using `GTEx_v8_genotype_EUR_HM3.bed`.
- Construct individual-specific sequences where **SNP positions are altered** based on genotype data.
- Save modified sequences as `genotype_sequences.fasta` for Enformer input.

### **2. Run Predictions**
- Use the fine-tuned **Enformer model** to **predict gene expression** for both:
  - The **original reference genome (hg38)**.
  - The **genotype-altered sequences**.
- Store prediction results for all gene expression tracks.

### **3. Compare Predictions**
- Compute **mean expression values** across all tracks.
- Analyze **log fold-change in expression** between reference and genotype-modified sequences.
- Identify SNPs that cause **significant expression changes**.
- Validate key findings using **GTEx eQTL results**, checking if SNPs with high predicted impact align with statistically significant eQTL signals.

### **4. SNP Impact Quantification**
To assess the functional impact of SNPs, we:
- Extracted the **top SNPs affecting gene expression** using Enformer-predicted signals.
- Compared results from:
  - **Full prediction matrix** (all Enformer tracks).
  - **Selected tracks correlated with gene expression** (e.g., chromatin accessibility and histone marks).
- Overlapped these results with **top eQTL SNPs**, identifying **41 shared SNPs** between Enformerâ€™s predictions and statistical eQTL analysis.

## **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Pearson correlation** between predicted and actual GTEx expression values.
- **Log fold-change** in expression for SNP-altered sequences.
- **eQTL validation rate**, assessing how well deep learning predictions align with empirical SNP-expression associations.

## **Results Summary**
- The **Enformer model's SNP impact predictions** largely aligned with traditional eQTL analyses, validating its ability to capture regulatory interactions.
- SNPs identified through **both Enformer and eQTL** were mostly located in **500 kb downstream of the APOE locus**, suggesting regulatory relevance.
- **Full prediction matrix vs. eQTL overlap:** **41 SNPs** matched.
- **Selected prediction tracks vs. eQTL overlap:** **33 SNPs** matched.

These findings indicate that **deep learning models can complement statistical eQTL methods**, helping to pinpoint SNPs with strong regulatory effects.

## **Next Steps**
- Expand the analysis to **disease-associated SNPs**, particularly those influencing gene expression of neurodegenerative risk loci.
- Investigate **cross-tissue regulatory variation**, using GTEx data from multiple tissues.
- Enhance the interpretability of Enformerâ€™s predictions through **functional genomic validation** (e.g., ChIP-seq, CRISPR perturbation assays).
