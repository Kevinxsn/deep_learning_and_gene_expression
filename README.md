# **Part 1: Gene Expression Prediction using Pre-Trained Enformer**

## **Overview**
This section describes how to use the pre-trained Enformer model to **predict gene expression** and analyze the impact of genetic variation. Our approach involves:
- **Using the reference genome (hg38) as input** for baseline predictions.
- **Replacing specific genomic regions** with individual-specific genotypes derived from **GTEx_v8_genotype_EUR_HM3** PLINK data.
- **Comparing predictions** Evaluate Enformer predictions with measured gene expression values.

   ```
   ./plink2 --bfile ./data/gtex_chr22 --out ./data/genotype_sequences22 --recode vcf
   ```
   Extract chromosome 22 from expression data
   ```
   awk 'NR==1 || $1 == "chr1"' ./data/Whole_Blood.v8.normalized_expression.bed > ./data/chr22_expression.bed
   ```
   
- Extract **reference genome** sequences from `38.fa`.

- One hot encode the modified sequences and convert to PyTorch tensor.

### **2. Run Predictions**

  - The one-hot encoded **genotype-altered sequences**.
- Store prediction results for all gene expression tracks.

### **3. Compare Predictions**

- Perform normalization and transform the mean predictions
- Fit a Stacked Model to fine tune the pipeline 

## **Evaluation Metrics**
- Pearson correlation between predicted and actual GTEx expression values.

## **Next Steps**
- Extend the prediction analysis to **disease-associated SNPs** linked to protein-coding genes.
- Compare **population-specific genotype effects** on gene expression.

### **3. Compare Predictions**
- Compute **mean expression values** across all tracks.
- Analyze **log fold-change in expression** between reference and genotype-modified sequences.
- Identify SNPs that cause **significant expression changes**.
- Validate key findings using **GTEx eQTL results**, checking if SNPs with high predicted impact align with statistically significant eQTL signals.

Pleae refer to [eQTL_apoe.ipynb](enformer_result_data_analysis/eQTL_apoe.ipynb) to see how to run eQTL of the gene APOE. 

### **4. SNP Impact Quantification**
To assess the functional impact of SNPs, we:
- Extracted the **top SNPs affecting gene expression** using Enformer-predicted signals.
- Compared results from:
  - **Full prediction matrix** (all Enformer tracks).
  - **Selected tracks correlated with gene expression** (e.g., chromatin accessibility and histone marks).
- Overlapped these results with **top eQTL SNPs**, identifying **41 shared SNPs** between Enformer‚Äôs predictions and statistical eQTL analysis.

Pleae refer to [result_analysis.ipynb](enformer_result_data_analysis/result_analysis.ipynb) to see the process of data analysis and making graphes. 

## **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Pearson correlation** between predicted and actual GTEx expression values.
- **Log fold-change** in expression for SNP-altered sequences.
- **eQTL validation rate**, assessing how well deep learning predictions align with empirical SNP-expression associations.

## **Results Summary**
- The **Enformer model's SNP impact predictions** largely aligned with traditional eQTL analyses, validating its ability to capture regulatory interactions.
- SNPs identified through **both Enformer and eQTL** were mostly located in **500 kb downstream of the APOE locus**, suggesting regulatory relevance.
- **Full prediction matrix vs. eQTL overlap:** **41 SNPs** matched.
- **Selected prediction tracks vs. eQTL overlap:** **33 SNPs** matched.


These findings indicate that **deep learning models can complement statistical eQTL methods**, helping to pinpoint SNPs with strong regulatory effects.

## **Next Steps**
- Expand the analysis to **disease-associated SNPs**, particularly those influencing gene expression of neurodegenerative risk loci.
- Investigate **cross-tissue regulatory variation**, using GTEx data from multiple tissues.
- Enhance the interpretability of Enformer‚Äôs predictions through **functional genomic validation** (e.g., ChIP-seq, CRISPR perturbation assays).
